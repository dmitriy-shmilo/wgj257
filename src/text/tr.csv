txt_intro1,"Hello. Are you my new assistant? Welcome. My name is Mr. Cash Money, I'm an executive director at this fine establishment. I presume HR showed you around already? Good.",,
txt_intro2,"Everybody in this company wants to book some time on my calendar, and it's your job to make sure I don't have to worry which meetings I'm supposed to be present on every week.",,
txt_intro3,"It's not all meets and greets for me, though. I still do some actual work around here too. So do me a favor and make sure I don't get stuck in back-to-back calls every day. Even if it means I have to skip a meeting or two. Alright? Alright.",,
txt_hint_payday,"Yeah, one of the perks of being my assistant is that you get paid ([img]res://assets/texture/icon_score.tres[/img]) daily. I'm not a frugal type, and will even throw an extra bonus for you if you perform well.",,
txt_hint_weekend,I love Fridays! You know why? Because they end! A day-long golf session will surely help me relax after a week of hard work.,,
txt_hint_time,"""We need this done yesterday"" are the words that I tell other people, not the other way around! How do you expect me to attend '%s' in the past?",,
txt_hint_expiration,"It came to my attention that '%s' was supposed to happen some time this week, but you didn't allocate any of my time for it. I'll let it slide this time, but do make sure that I don't miss a lot of meetings. It's bad for my rep.",,
txt_hint_no_reschedule,"The guys running '%s' are quite busy ([img]res://assets/texture/icon_lock.tres[/img]). Once we decide the time, they won't agree to a reschedule.",,
txt_hint_important,"It's extremely important ([img]res://assets/texture/icon_warning.tres[/img]) that I attend this upcoming '%s'. Make sure it's on my radar, or I'm going to be REALLY upset.",,
txt_hint_unimportant,"Ugh, '%s' is just clutter on my calendar. I bet nobody will even notice if I don't come.",,
txt_hint_leisure,"Ooh, I love me some '%s'! Really helps with stress management.",,
txt_hint_free_time,"Meetings, calls, meetings, conferences! When am I supposed to do any actual work?! Leave some blank spaces on my calendar, so I can focus on important stuff!",,
txt_hint_start,"Now. Let's get started, shall we? I know there's a couple of pending appointments already, waiting to be booked on my calendar. Just drag 'em up from the queue, and I'll attend them once the time comes.",,
txt_hint_reschedule,"Feel free to move my appointments around the board even after they're placed. You can reschedule most of my meetings to give me some breathing room. Obviously you can't move an event, which happened in the past or happening right now!",,
txt_hint_in_progress,What do you think you're doing? You can't reschedule '%s'! I'm already here!,,
